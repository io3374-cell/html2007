The early internet was a wild and creative space. People could build their own websites, borrow bits of code from others, and make something totally unique. 
It wasn’t polished or perfect, but that was the point. It was personal, messy, and full of strange experiments. Reweirding the internet means bringing back 
that freedom to play and create without worrying about fitting into a clean template. Making this site from scratch feels like a throwback to those early days.
It reminds me of websites we explored in class like My Boyfriend Came Back from the War by Olia Lialina, which used simple HTML to tell a fragmented story. 
In class, we talked about how people used to copy parts of websites and remix them. That kind of openness made the web feel like a shared playground.
Today, most websites look the same and are built with tools that limit creativity. Reweirding is about breaking out of that and making space for glitchy, handmade, 
and unexpected designs. Trevor Paglen’s essay Invisible Images helped me think about this differently. He writes, “The relationship between images and power in 
the machine-machine landscape is different than in the human visual landscape.” That line stuck with me. It shows how the internet has changed from a place for 
people to express themselves to a space where machines talk to machines, often for surveillance or control. Reweirding is a way to push back and make the internet 
feel human again. So here's Kungfu Panda:

                <p>
                  Wow.. This is freaky. Before I had even got the chance to write my "About Me" an ai generated responce was given to me as an option. Let's see what it comes up with.
                   Ai: "I am Ifeoluwa Oyaniyi, a Bard College undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I have a passion for technology, coding, and problem-solving. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, video games, and exploring the outdoors on my bike. I am also an avid reader of science fiction novels, with "The Three Body Problem" trilogy by Cixin Liu being one of my favorites. Music is another significant part of my life, and I often find myself listening to tracks like "Sunflower" by Post Malone. My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills in computer science to make a positive impact in the tech industry while continuously learning and growing both personally and professionally."
                   LMAO ok that's freaky because it used the responses I had already written within my website to formulate a genaric answer. That's honestly scary as hell. Well for starters I'm an intented Bio major not computer science.  I do enjoy playing soccer, video games, and I wouldnt say "exploring the outdoors on my bike" is a hobby of mine but I do like science fiction... Music is indeed a part of my life but I don't often listen to "tracks like sunflower" it sudgests I keep myself within one specific neiche when in reality I'm all over the place. I don' have one specific artist I listen to I just listen to whatever sounds good. And, you know, making a positive impact on the tech industry sounds nice and all but I'd rather pursue a carrer in STEM.
